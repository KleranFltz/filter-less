# filter-less

This program applies filters to images in the c language.

helpers.c is the only file that I wrote. This project was done for the Cs50 harvard course that is free on EDX

It deals with the images as 2d arrays of pixels, applying the grayscale affect, blur affect, sepia affect, and reflect affect
each with their own different functionalities.

some image files are attached to use for testing.
